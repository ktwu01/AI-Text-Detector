The AI Word and Phrase Highlighter is designed to detect common words and phrases frequently used in AI-generated content.

### How it works

1. The tool maintains a database of words and phrases commonly used by AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, and others.
2. When you input text, it scans for these markers and highlights them.
3. It also provides statistics on the frequency of these markers in your text.

### Use cases

- Writers can use this to reduce AI-like patterns in their writing
- Content reviewers can quickly identify potential AI-generated content
- Students and educators can ensure original work
- SEO specialists can improve content to avoid AI detection penalties

### Sources

The default database includes words and phrases identified by various AI detection tools including:

- ZeroGPT
- GPTZero
- Originality.ai
- And various research studies on AI-generated text patterns

You can extend the database with your own observations or from other sources.
